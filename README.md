# mmrs-format-updater
A python script that updates standalone sequences and old format MMRS files into the meta MMRS format

Just drag and drop a folder or any number of individual files onto the python script to run it.

The output folder is named `converted` and its location will be the following:
- Individual files: The folder is located in the same folder as the input files.
- Folder: The folder is located inside of the original root folder. The structure of the entire folder is retained, and all converted music files are located in their original folders.
